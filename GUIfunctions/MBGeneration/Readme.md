# Short readme for MB generation module
*Date* 2022/07/22

*Author* Baptiste Heiles

## List of folders and content
- data : Folder containing the sonovue distribution
- example_data : Folder containing example data to provide a MWE
- functions : Folder containing all functions used for the MB generation and to convert python data to Matlab
- scripts : Folder containg the scripts to generate MBs from the streamline with Matlab

## MWE

1. Run the script : "C:\Users\bheiles\Documents\Github\microbubble-flow-simulator-gui\GUIfunctions\MBGeneration\scripts\Matlab\script_brain.m"
2. You're done

## TODO list
- [ ] Add the distribution from Nathan
- [ ] Do you want nice images of the streamlines with the mesh Nathan?

## TOCHECK list
- [x] Check minLength threshold (why does Nathan end up with single streamlines?)
- [ ] Flat streamlines?
- [x] Check MB Diameter change rule after end of streamline
- [x] Check .stl vs .vtu
- [ ] Upload a more complete dataset on surf drive
